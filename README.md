# Purpose:

The Chia Dwv Community meetings provide a forum for the developer community to gather and discuss various technical topics, including CHIPS proposals. The meetings also provide a platform for the community to support each other in building a secure, sustainable, and compliant blockchain technology. 

# Agenda: 
The agenda for each meeting is tracked with GitHub issues. Please use GitHub issues to propose new sessions or suggest agenda items for scheduled meetings. Planned or scheduled meeting will be listed on the [meeting list project](https://github.com/Chia-Network/dev-community-meetings/projects/1).


## Guidelines for CHIPS discussion:
The CHIP should be published and in draft status for at least two weeks before scheduling the meeting to give the community ample time to comprehend the proposal. 
The agenda of the CHIPS meeting should only focus on the CHIPS proposals, and it should include two main items: 
CHIP Author to present the CHIP
Community feedback and discussion
The CHIP author should take notes and incorporate feedback from the meeting into the CHIP. 


# Facilitation: 
Chia DevRel team facilitates the meeting.
