# Purpose:

The Chia Dev Community Meetings provide a forum for the developer community to gather and discuss various technical topics, including [CHIPs proposals](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chips). The meetings also provide a platform for the community to support each other in building a secure, sustainable, and compliant blockchain technology. 

# Agenda: 
- The agenda for each meeting is tracked with GitHub issues. 
- Please use GitHub issues to propose new sessions or suggest agenda items for scheduled meetings. 
- Planned or scheduled meetings will be displayed on the [Meetings List project](https://github.com/Chia-Network/dev-community-meetings/projects/1).

## Guidelines for CHIPs discussion:
- The CHIP should be published and in draft status for at least two weeks before scheduling the meeting to give the community ample time to digest the proposal. 
- The agenda of the CHIPs meeting should only focus on the CHIP's proposals, and it should include two main items: 
  - CHIP Author to present the CHIP
  - Community feedback and discussion
- The CHIP author is responsible for taking notes and incorporating feedback from the meeting into the respective CHIP. 

# Facilitation: 
- Chia DevRel team helps facilitate the meetings.
